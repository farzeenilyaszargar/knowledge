# Analysis of Algorithms

## Order of Growth  
*n! > 2<sup>n</sup> >  n<sup>2</sup> > n log n > n > log n > 1*

## Algorithm efficiency â€“ best case, worst case, average case

- best case (big Omega)
- average case (big Theta)
- worst case (big Oh)
  


## Analysis of Non Recursive Algorithms
- a normal statement has O(1) time complexity
- a looping statement that loops n times has O(n) time complexity

## Analysis of Recursive Algorithms
recursive algorithms have different ways of finding out time complexity
- recursive tree method
- backtracking method
- subsitution method
- masters theorem
